We are forgotten satellites
Hurtling through space and time
Haphazard oscillations
Attempting to avoid space junk
We’re pulled toward each others orbit
Then we drift apart
Navigating this inky infinity
You’re like the celestial bodies around us.
You don’t have to be in my radar to know 
you’re out there,
And here
And within
We’re already thrown off course
So let’s undulate 
Til we inevitably collide……and share atoms.
